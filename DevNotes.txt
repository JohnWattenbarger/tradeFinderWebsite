Possible improvements:
 > Have multiple player trades that are lopsided (3 - 1 or something)
 > For multiple player trades, allow clicking to disable the player from the trade (preview what would change if a player were removed)
 > Add sorting options (sort by best overall gain, best for my team, etc.)
 > Add a max difference between team improvements (so I don't gain 1000 points but the other guy gains 10000 points)
 > Add filter to exclude some teams
 > Add a "Favorite" button to save trades I like
 > Make it possible to hide/include trades only involving certain teams
   > Like hide trades involving Jared's team
 > Look into why app freezes up when inputs are changed
   > Are they recalculating the trades??
 > Add async trade finder logic
 > Show loading symbol
 > Use a framework for graphics?
